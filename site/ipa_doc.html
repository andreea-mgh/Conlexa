    <h2>Wordshift Documentation</h2>
    <p>Wordshift is a tool for applying sound changes to words. It is enabled by default on dictionary entries and checks if a valid ruleset has been defined for the word's language.</p>
    <p>To define a ruleset, go to the <a href="/phono/ipa">IPA Rulesets</a> page and click on a language. The ruleset editor allows you to define sound changes using a simple syntax. Once you have defined a ruleset, it will be automatically applied to all words in that language as long as the syntax is valid.</p>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <h4>Sections</h4>
    <p>A ruleset is divided into sections, defined by a <code>$</code> symbol at the beginning of the line.</p>


    <h5>$GROUP</h5>
    <p>This section defines symbols or groups of symbols that can be referenced in the rules. Each line defines a group in the format <code>NAME:symbol1,symbol2,...</code> where NAME is a capital letter. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>$GROUP
V:a,e,i,o,u
K:p,t,k</code></pre>
    <p>This defines a group <em>V</em> that represents the vowels and a group <em>K</em> that represents the voiceless stops.</p>


    <h5>$SUBST</h5>
    <p>This section defines the first stage of substitution in the ruleset. What is particular about this section is the fact that <em>the substitutions will not overlap</em>. It is meant for general letter/digraph to sound mapping. The syntax is also simpler than in the other substitution sections, with the only format accepted being <code>pattern:replacement</code>.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre><code>$SUBST
ei:e
e:ɛ
ch:k
sh:ʃ
th:θ</code></pre>
    <p>If this ruleset would be applied to a word like <em>chein</em>, it would be transformed to <em>chen</em> after the first rule but the second rule would not be able to transform it further into <em>chɛn</em> because the "ei" group has already been substituted, making this section perfect for simple sound mapping.</p>

    
    <h5>$POST</h5>
    <p>This section defines the second stage of substitution in the ruleset. The syntax is more complex than in the $SUBST section. The minimal syntax is <code>pattern:replacement</code>, but can be expanded with an optional parameter: <code>pattern:replacement:context</code>. The context part is optional and can be used to specify when the substitution should occur.</p>
    <p>This section can also reference groups defined in the <code>$GROUP</code> section.</p>
    <p>The context part is a string containing an underscore, representing the substitution. In this string you can also include the word boundary as <code>%</code>.</p>
    <p>For example, if you have a group <code>V:a,e,i,o,u</code> in the <code>$GROUP</code> section, you can use it in the <code>$POST</code> section like this:</p>
    <pre><code>$POST
V:ɛ:V_
V:ɔ:_V</code></pre>
    <p>This would replace vowels with ɛ after another vowel and with ɔ before another vowel.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that these substitutions can be applied on top of each other.</p>
    
    <h4>Comments</h4>
    <p>You can add comments to your ruleset by starting a line with <code>#</code>. Comments are ignored by the ruleset processor and can be used to explain the purpose of certain rules or to temporarily disable them. Comments are stored on save.</p>
    <p>The processor also ignores newlines and whitespace.</p>
